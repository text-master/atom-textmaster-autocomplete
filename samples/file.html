			Go ahead, start typing the name of a fruit (basic provider), the word
			"super" (intermediate provider), or "@" (advanced provider).

		<!--
			Ah, but here's an exception! The advanced provider is specifically disabled
			within comments. Go head, type "@" inside this comment and notice that
			"@snippet" suggestions won't appear. Others will.
