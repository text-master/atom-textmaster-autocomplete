Minnesota high school teachers, administrators and contractors are legally allowed to have sex with their students over the age of 18.

And it happens.

“Fortunately, teachers having sex with students is not very common,” Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom said in an interview. “But unfortunately, when it does happen, we can’t prosecute — but it’s just wrong.”

Last year, an 18-year-old Burnsville High School student reported having sexual relations with a male teacher, Backstrom said. His office investigated but could not press charges.

That’s because state law says that when someone turns 18, they are no longer covered by statutes that prevent authority figures like teachers from having a sexual relationship with them. The act might be against school policies, but it’s not illegal.

In 2007, Charles Ames Brookins, 29, a Hastings High School baseball and softball coach, was charged with providing liquor to several students. He pleaded guilty. He was not charged with the thing that brought his case to authorities’ attention: allegedly having sex with an 18-year-old softball player.

Following that case, Backstrom pushed for state laws to be changed, but it didn’t happen.

Now it might.
