A pile of tributes of flowers and feather dusters – or “tickling sticks” – has begun to grow outside the 18th-century house in Knotty Ash, Liverpool, where comedian Ken Dodd was born and died.

Allan Grice, a 71-year-old retired senior fire officer, made the three-hour journey from Wakefield to Dodd’s home to hand-deliver a card of condolence after hearing of the comedian’s death on the radio in the early hours of Monday morning.

“I felt this compulsion to come along because sometimes, if you don’t do things, you wish you had,” he said. He caught a train to Leeds at 6.31am, then took the TransPennine Express to Liverpool Lime Street, from where he found a bus that would take him to Knotty Ash.

“Many people are going to say the same, but I think it’s surely true that [Dodd] broke the mould,” said Grice. “Truly, the happiness that he brought to people was absolutely amazing. It’s a sad day and I think a lot of fans are collectively crying for him, if that doesn’t sound too schmaltzy.”

Dodd’s humour was special because he never lost the “common touch”, he added. “These are his roots. This was where he was born … He never changed his accent and he ended his life where he began it.”

Giving a statement to a crowd of reporters waiting in the rain, Dodd’s partner of four decades, Anne Jones – whom he married on Friday – said she had first met the comedian when she was in the Ken Dodd Christmas show in 1961 at the Manchester Opera House.
